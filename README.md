# XYZ-Bank-DC-DR-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
XYZ Bank DC &amp; DR Implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer.

This repository contains the design and simulation of the Data Centre (DC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) environments for XYZ Bank, implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates how to build a secure, scalable, and redundant network infrastructure to ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities for the bank's operations.

Key Features:
Cisco Packet Tracer simulations of the primary Data Centre (DC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) environments.

VLAN segmentation, OSPF routing, and HSRP for redundancy and failover between the DC and DR sites.

Network diagrams showcasing the architecture of DC and DR, including IP segmentation and switch-based separation for different departments.

Scalable IP addressing with dynamic DHCP for users and static IPs for servers and critical devices.

Implementation of HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) for fault tolerance and automatic failover.

Security features such as firewalls and VPNs to secure communication between the head office, data center, and DR site.

Configurations for future expansion and scalability of the network.
